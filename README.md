This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is my attempt at Udacity's React-Rudux course. We'll see how it goes.

Installation is pretty simple:

1. Fork or clone me (this repo)
2. npm install from the root
3. You will need to grab the backend server by cloning and forking
    https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
    you will also need to npm install that from the root directory
4. Startup the backend server (yarn start) and it will run on port 3001
5. You can load up the web app for writing and commenting on port 3001

Have fun!
